**Note: MidiJack is superseded by a new MIDI plugin [Minis]. Although you can
still use MidiJack with the latest Unity version, it's recommended to migrate
to Minis for further updates.**

API Reference
-------------

The basic functions of MIDI Jack are provided in the MidiMaster class.

The channel arguments in the following functions can be omitted.
In that case, the functions return the values in the All-Channel slot, which stores
mixed status of all active channels.

*Input* 

- MidiMaster.GetKey (channel, noteNumber)

  Returns the velocity value while the key is pressed, or zero while the
  key is released. The value ranges from 0.0 (note-off) to 1.0 (maximum
  velocity).

- MidiMaster.GetKeyDown (channel, noteNumber)

  Returns true during the frame the user starts pressing down the key.

- MidiMaster.GetKeyUp (channel, noteNumber)

  Returns true during the frame the user releases the key.

- MidiMaster.GetKnob (channel, knobNumber, defaultValue)

  Returns the controller value (CC). The value ranges from 0.0 to 1.0.

- MidiMaster.GetKnobNumbers (channel)

  Returns the list of active controllers.

There are also delegates for the each type of MIDI event.

- MidiMaster.noteOnDelegate (channel, noteNumber, velocity)
- MidiMaster.noteOffDelegate (channel, noteNumber)
- MidiMaster.knobDelegate (channel, knobNumber, konbValue)


*Output*

- MidiMaster.SendMessage(deviceID, message)

  send entire MIDI message to device.

- MidiMaster.SendNoteOn(deviceID, channel, noteNumber, velocity)

  send note on to device. velocity is 0.0 to 1.0 range.

- MidiMaster.SendNoteOff(deviceID, channel, noteNumber, velocity)

  send note off to device.

- MidiMaster.SendCC(deviceID, channel, ccNumber, value)

  send CC message to device. value is 0.0 to 1.0 range.

- MidiMaster.SendChannelMessage(deviceID, statusbyte, databyte)

- MidiMaster.SendChannelMessage(deviceID, statusbyte, channel, databyte)

you can find out how to identify _Device ID_ from example code  _SendTestMIDIManager.cs_, with scenes in _Assets/ExampleSend_.


MIDI Monitor Window
-------------------

MIDI Jack provides the MIDI Monitor window, which shows the list of
active devices and incoming MIDI messages.

The MIDI Monitor window is available from the menu `Window` -> `MIDI Jack`.

Current Limitations
-------------------

- Currently MIDI Jack only supports Windows and OS X. No iOS support yet.
- Only supports note and CC messages. No support for program changes nor
  SysEx.
- The MIDI Jack plugin always tries to capture all available MIDI devices.
  On Windows this behavior may conflict with other MIDI applications.
